    <h1>Apr 12.</h1>

    <p>My sister was struggling on her multiplication skills. My dad kept asking me to help her with that. He told me all I needed to do was to write down problems for her. But it was really annoying, when whe kept coming back, saying, "Dad, asked you to write down more problems." So I took the lazy way out and I made a program for this.</p>
