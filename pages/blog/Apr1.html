    <h1>Apr 1.</h1>

    <p>April Fools! Today is just a button, I am working on a really big project that will be posted if I'm on schedule in around 2-3 days. Anyway, my friend pranked me so hard. He told me that we were mentioned in TechCrunch, he made a clone. He then pretended not to want to show me. After I persuaded him for ten minutes he showed me and all it said was a short article on how he was better than me. Check it out at - <a href="http://techcrunch.com.4fhe.clonezone.link/kabirisbetter">TechCrunch</a></p>
