    <p>Streaks! I named it that since, there are sort of streaks after each circle. It is pretty impressive isn't it. Anyway, the streaks are made anyway, even in the explosion program. I just had to show them. All you need to do is change the transparency of the background. Hopefully, this doesn't hurt your eyes. :)</p>
