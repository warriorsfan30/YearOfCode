    <h1>Apr 6.</h1>

    <p>I made this using a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) selector. It was called ::selection, when a preson highlights the text it just changes what happens when you highlight it. It barely took 2 minutes to make. Anyway, this is going up slightly late since GitHub was down for maintentance.</p>
