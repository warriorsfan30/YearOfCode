    <h1>Apr 4.</h1>

    <p>Friends can be inspiration in interesting ways. My friend made something very similar, and I just used that as inspiration to make something like this. It is pretty cool it makes circles, but instead of redrawing the background, I leave it the way it is, and gives you a weird tentacle like effect.</p>
